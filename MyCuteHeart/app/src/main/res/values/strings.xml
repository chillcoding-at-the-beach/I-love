"\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,"
"\nAnd sorry I could not travel both"
"\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood"
"\nAnd looked down one as far as I could"
"\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;"
"\nThen took the other, as just as fair,"
"\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,"

"\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I-"

"The City in the Sea\n"
"\nLo! Death has reared himself a throne"
"\nIn a strange city lying alone"
"\nFar down within the dim West,"
"\nWhere the good and the bad and the worst and the best"
"\nHave gone to their eternal rest."
"\nThere shrines and palaces and towers"
"\n(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)"
"\nResemble nothing that is ours."
"\nAround, by lifting winds forgot,"
"\nResignedly beneath the sky"
"\nThe melancholy waters lie."
"\nNo rays from the holy heaven come down"
"\nOn the long night-time of that town;"
"\nBut light from out the lurid sea"
"\nStreams up the turrets silently-"
"\nGleams up the pinnacles far and free-"
"\nUp domes- up spires- up kingly halls-"
"\nUp fanes- up Babylon-like walls-"
"\nUp shadowy long-forgotten bowers"
"\nOf sculptured ivy and stone flowers-"
"\nUp many and many a marvellous shrine"
"\nWhose wreathed friezes intertwine"
"\nThe viol, the violet, and the vine."
"\nResignedly beneath the sky"
"\nThe melancholy waters lie."
"\nSo blend the turrets and shadows there"
"\nThat all seem pendulous in air,"
"\nWhile from a proud tower in the town"
"\nDeath looks gigantically down.\n"

"\nThere open fanes and gaping graves"
"\nYawn level with the luminous waves;"
"\nBut not the riches there that lie"
"\nIn each idol's diamond eye-"
"\nNot the gaily-jewelled dead"
"\nTempt the waters from their bed;"
"\nFor no ripples curl, alas!"
"\nAlong that wilderness of glass-"
"\nNo swellings tell that winds may be"
"\nUpon some far-off happier sea-"
"\nNo heavings hint that winds have been"
"\nOn seas less hideously serene."

"\nBut lo, a stir is in the air!"
"\nThe wave- there is a movement there!"
"\nAs if the towers had thrust aside,"
"\nIn slightly sinking, the dull tide-"
"\nAs if their tops had feebly given"
"\nA void within the filmy Heaven."
"\nThe waves have now a redder glow-"
"\nThe hours are breathing faint and low-"
"\nAnd when, amid no earthly moans,"
"\nDown, down that town shall settle hence,"
"\nHell, rising from a thousand thrones,"
"\nShall do it reverence.\n"
"\n-> Edgar Allan Poe\n"
